# animalgame

A CLI game where you can buy, sell, feed and breed animals - 1 to 4 players and 5 to 30 rounds. Game starts by running "Main".
Every round health depreciates by a random amount, 10-30%. Health can be gained by feeding an animal.
One category can be performed every round (buy, sell, feel, breed), but you perform multiple actions within the same category, limited only by your resources.

Created with Java, making use of classes/objects, abstract classes and inheritance.
A group project for a Java course.
